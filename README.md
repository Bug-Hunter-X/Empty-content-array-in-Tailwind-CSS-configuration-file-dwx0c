# Empty content array in Tailwind CSS configuration file

This repository contains a simple Tailwind CSS configuration file with an empty content array. This can lead to a variety of errors, such as styles not being applied or unexpected behavior.

## Bug

The `content` array in the `tailwind.config.js` file is empty. This means that Tailwind CSS will not process any of the files in your project. This can lead to errors such as styles not being applied.

## Solution

The solution is to populate the `content` array with the paths to the files that you want Tailwind CSS to process. For example, you could add the following line to the `content` array:

```javascript
content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
```

This will tell Tailwind CSS to process all of the files in the `src` directory that have the extensions `.html`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx`. You should adjust the path to match the location of your files.
